# Learnt Blochain concepts

## 1. Smart Contract
Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. They are typically used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome.

## 2. Proof Of Work
Proof-of-work is the mechanism that allows the blockchain to come to consensus. This is used to confirm transactions and produce new blocks to the chain. With Proof of Work, miners compete against each other to complete transactions on the network.
